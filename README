Overlay for HAC-specific things
===============================

This is for the Nintendo Switch.

This is a Nix overlay that (tries) to include everything to use the *shofel2*
tethered exploit for the Nintendo Switch (HAC-001) and some bonus goodies.

* * *

It is expected that two systems will be needed to make full use of this
overlay.

 * A host system to launch the exploit (only x86_64 has been tested).
 * A build system (AArch64) to build the kernel and system image.

It is possible to use an already-built kernel and system image, if you can
find one around.

It should also be possible to use the tools provided here to boot non-NixOS
kernels and images using *shofel2*.
